  [Late Junction](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tp52) is a programme on
  [BBC Radio 3](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3) that has been running since 1999.

  When I created this project initially, the BBC had archived playlists going
  back to [2004](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/latejunction/pip/archive/?2004),
  either in plain text (for older episodes) or a more structured format
  recently. Now they only show episodes back to
  [2007](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tp52/broadcasts/2007/07), and
  don't have playlists for all the old episodes. This project uses
  screen-scraping, and keeping the scrapers up to date with the BBC's changing
  website isn't much fun, so the last available episodes here are from 2016.

  Hence: this mini-site is an archive of all playlists from 2004 to 2016, parsed
  into a common format.

  There's no particular reason for this, I just thought it would be fun! If you
  find any issues (there will be many, many issues, both due to irregularities
  in the way these have been displayed on the web page, as well as my own
  mistakes), please [let me know](http://sean.mcgivern.me.uk/#contact).

  Two technical notes: the colours for presenters are Set3 taken from the
  fantastic [Colorbrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/), and the source is available
  on GitHub at
  [smcgivern/late-junction-playlists](https://github.com/smcgivern/late-junction-playlists).
